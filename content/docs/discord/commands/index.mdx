Commands are native ways to interact with Discord bots. There are 3 types of commands accessible in different interfaces: **The chat input**, the **context menu for a message** (right-clicking on a message) and the **context menu for a user** (right click on a user).

Chat input commands have autocomplete options that can be replied simply using this bot base.
